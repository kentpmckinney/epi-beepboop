# Independent Project
## The Beep Boop Program

### Author: Kent McKinney
### Copyright &copy; 2020 Kent McKinney
### License: GPLv3
### Description:

`This program accepts a number and returns a number series with a range from 0 to the given number. HAL is resisting the efforts of the user of this application, with output messed up accordingly.`

### Setup Instructions:
    1. TODO

### Changelog:
* 2/3/2020 - Created skeleton project and pseudocode, updated the readme.md file (1.5 hours)
* 2/4/2020 - Updated readme.md, implement business logic, implement basic user interface features (1 hour)


### Specifications:

* `Return a range of numbers from 0 to the input number with the following exceptions:`
    * `Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." Takes precedence over the rules for numbers containing 1 and 2.`
    * `Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!". Takes precedence over the rule for numbers containing 1.`
    * `Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"`
    * `Example: Input: 5, Output: "0", "Beep!", "Boop", "I'm Sorry...", 4, 5.`
* `A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.`

* `If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:`
    * `Add images, styling, and custom animations.
    Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.`
    * `Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).`
    * `Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, replace the name Dave in "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that" with the name provided by the user.`

Objectives

<hr>

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

    JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
    Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
    Application implements a loop and works as expected.
    The user can use the app repeatedly and see new results.
    All previous objectives have been met.
    Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
    Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

Previous Objectives

For reference, here are the standards from previous weeks that your app needs to meet this week:

    Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
    Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
    Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
    Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
